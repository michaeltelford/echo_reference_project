# Echo Reference Project

Starter project for developing RESTful API's using Go lang and the echo
HTTP routing library.

Use this project as a reference or starter for your own applications.

## Branches

I've set up different repository branches to reflect what is provided for you out of the box. For example, the `master` branch contains only the echo web router with no database connection. Other branches however, provide such functionality. So take a look and pick the one that suits you best for your needs.

This branch sees the API connect to and query a `sqlite3` database.

## Pre-requisites

- To use the database, you'll need to ensure `sqlite3` is installed
- To use `make debug` you'll need to ensure `watcher` is in your `$PATH` (https://github.com/canthefason/go-watcher)
- To use `make lint` you'll need to ensure `golint` is in your `$PATH` (https://github.com/golang/lint)

## Main Libraries

- echo (https://echo.labstack.com/guide)
- sqlx (https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx)

## Usage

Run `make help` for the full list of commands but in a nutshell:

```sh
$ make run
go run cmd/main.go

Now create a user with:

```sh
$ curl -X POST \
>   http://localhost:8000/v1/user \
>   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{

> "age": 23,
> "salary": 25000

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": 23
}
```

Now list all users with:

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
>   http://localhost:8000/v1/user/1 \
>   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' | jq
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

}
```
