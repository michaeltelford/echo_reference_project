# Echo Reference Project

Starter project for developing RESTful API's using Go lang and the Echo HTTP web development framework.

Use this project as a reference or starter for your own applications.

## Branches

I've set up different repository branches to reflect what is provided for you out of the box. For example, the `master` branch contains only the Echo web router with no database connection. Other branches however, provide such functionality. So take a look and pick the one that suits you best for your needs.

This branch sees the API connect to and query a `postgres` database.

## Pre-requisites

- To use the database and API, you'll need to ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed
- To use `make debug` you'll need to ensure `watcher` is in your `$PATH` (https://github.com/canthefason/go-watcher)
- To use `make convey` you'll need to ensure `goconvey` is in your `$PATH` (https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey)
- To use `make lint` you'll need to ensure `golint` is in your `$PATH` (https://github.com/golang/lint)
- To use `make dep` you'll need to ensure `dep` in in your `$PATH` (`brew install dep`)

Now create an author with:

```sh
$ curl -X POST \

>   -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
>   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   -d '{

}
```

Now retrieve the author with:

```sh
$ curl -X GET \
